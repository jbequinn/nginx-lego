Nginx Lego Docker Image
=======================

## What's this ##
This is a simple [Nginx Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) image with [Lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) to automate [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate generation and renewal. Currently only supported for [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) (for both main domain and subdomains -wildcard) and only for the dns-01 challenge.

The Nginx configuration is based on the [NGINXConfig from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/nginx) and the [SSL Configuration Generator from Mozilla](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/).

SSL certificates are checked every night for renewal (without contacting Let's Encrypt), and renewals are done when the certificates have less than 30 days to expire.

## How to use ##
Just add your subdomain configuration files in `/config/nginx/sites-enabled`, with a name ending in `subdomain.conf`. Here's an example:
```
server {
    include             /etc/nginx/conf.d/subdomains-common;
    server_name         subdomain.*;

    # security
    include             /config/nginx/security.conf;

    # reverse proxy
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://$docker_host:3000;
        include    /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
    }

    # additional config
    include /config/nginx/general.conf;
}
```

## Building ##
Build using the command:
```
docker build --no-cache --pull -t my-nginx:1.19-alpine-1 .
```
## Running ##
